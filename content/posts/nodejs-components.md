The backend development process has been revolutionized by Node.js, a JavaScript runtime based on the **V8** engine of Chrome. Its accomplishment is mostly due to the effective fusion of its fundamental components.

1. While JavaScript is typically thought of as an interpreted language, modern JavaScript engines now compile JavaScript. Node.js makes use of the V8 engine, which greatly speeds up execution by converting code into native machine code at runtime via **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation.

2. To efficiently handle asynchronous operations, Node.js makes use of the **libuv** library in addition to the V8 engine. Libuv is essential to Node.js's ability to stay non-blocking since it offers asynchronous I/O operations, with the **event loop** controlling the execution flow.

3. A wide range of built-in modules in the Node.js standard library offer essential functionality for creating applications. These modules give developers the tools they need to create robust programs. They include `fs` for file system interaction, `http` for HTTP server setup, and `net` for managing TCP and UDP sockets.
